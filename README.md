# AngularApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.3.7.

## Prerequisites
Before you start, make sure you have the following installed:

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en): Angular requires Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager). You can download and install Node.js [from the official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en). This will also install npm, which is required to manage the project dependencies.

To check if Node.js and npm are installed, you can use the following commands:

`node -v`
`npm -v`

If Node.js and npm are not installed, follow the installation instructions on the Node.js website.

Angular CLI: Angular CLI is used to create and manage Angular projects. Once Node.js and npm are installed, you can install Angular CLI globally using npm:

`npm install -g @angular/cli`

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
